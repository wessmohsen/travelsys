# Authorization System Fix - Operation Manager Role

## Problem Identified
The **Operation Manager** role was given access to ALL master data routes (Hotels, Trips, Boats, Drivers, Vehicles, Guides, Agencies, Transfer Contracts) even though it should only have access to **Trip Programs** and **Program Families**.

## Root Cause
The routes were protected using **ROLE-based middleware**:
```php
Route::middleware(['role:admin,manager,operation-manager'])->group(function () {
    // ALL master data routes were here
    Route::resource('hotels', HotelController::class);
    Route::resource('trips', TripController::class);
    // ... etc
});
```

This meant: **If you have the Operation Manager ROLE, you can access EVERYTHING in that route group** - regardless of individual permissions assigned to the role.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Route Restructuring (routes/web.php)
Separated routes into three groups based on actual access requirements:

#### Group 1: All Authenticated Users
- Customers
- Bookings
- AJAX routes

#### Group 2: Trip Programs Only - Admin, Manager, and Operation Manager
```php
Route::middleware(['role:admin,manager,operation-manager'])->group(function () {
    Route::resource('trip-programs', TripProgramController::class);
    // ... all trip program family routes
});
```

#### Group 3: Master Data - Admin and Manager ONLY
```php
Route::middleware(['role:admin,manager'])->group(function () {
    Route::resource('hotels', HotelController::class);
    Route::resource('trips', TripController::class);
    Route::resource('boats', BoatController::class);
    Route::resource('drivers', DriverController::class);
    Route::resource('vehicles', VehicleController::class);
    Route::resource('diving-courses', DivingCourseController::class);
    Route::resource('guides', GuideController::class);
    Route::resource('transfercontracts', TransferContractController::class);
    Route::resource('agencies', AgencyController::class);
});
```

### 2. Navigation Menu Update (config/modules.php)
Removed `'operation-manager'` from the roles array of all master data menu items:
- Hotels: `['admin', 'manager']`
- Trips: `['admin', 'manager']`
- Boats: `['admin', 'manager']`
- Transportation (Drivers, Vehicles, Transfer Contracts): `['admin', 'manager']`
- Diving Courses: `['admin', 'manager']`
- Guides: `['admin', 'manager']`
- Agencies: `['admin', 'manager']`

**Operation Programs** still shows for: `['admin', 'manager', 'operation-manager']` ✅

## Current Access Matrix

### Admin Role
- ✅ Full access to everything (via Gate::before)
- 29 permissions

### Manager Role
- ✅ All master data (Hotels, Trips, Boats, Drivers, Vehicles, Guides, Agencies, Transfer Contracts)
- ✅ Trip Programs & Families
- ✅ Customers & Bookings
- ✅ View Users
- ✅ View Reports
- 16 permissions total

### Operation Manager Role
- ❌ **NO** access to master data (Hotels, Trips, Boats, etc.)
- ❌ **NO** access to Customers & Bookings
- ✅ **ONLY** Trip Programs & Program Families
- ✅ View Reports
- 9 permissions total:
  - view-trip-programs, create-trip-programs, edit-trip-programs, delete-trip-programs
  - view-program-families, create-program-families, edit-program-families, delete-program-families
  - view-reports

### User Role
- ❌ **NO** access to master data
- ❌ **NO** access to Trip Programs
- ❌ **NO** access to Customers & Bookings
- ✅ Dashboard only
- 0 permissions (basic user)

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Login as an Operation Manager user
2. Check navigation menu - should NOT see Hotels, Trips, Boats, Transportation, Diving Courses, Guides, or Agencies
3. Try to manually access `/hotels` - should get 403 Forbidden
4. SHOULD be able to access `/trip-programs` ✅

## Technical Notes
- The difference between **Role-based** vs **Permission-based** authorization:
  - **Role middleware**: Checks if user HAS the role → grants access to ENTIRE route group
  - **Permission checks**: Checks specific permission for each action → granular control
  
- For broader access control, use role-based route grouping (as fixed)
- For fine-grained control within a controller, add permission checks in methods using `$this->authorize('permission-name')`
