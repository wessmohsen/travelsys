# Roles & Permissions System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Database Structure**
- Created `roles` table (id, name, slug, description)
- Created `permissions` table (id, name, slug, description)  
- Created `role_user` pivot table (user_id, role_id)
- Created `permission_role` pivot table (role_id, permission_id)

### 2. **Models with Relationships**
- **User Model**: Added role relationships and helper methods
  - `hasRole($role)` - Check if user has a specific role
  - `hasAnyRole(...$roles)` - Check if user has any of the given roles
  - `hasPermission($permission)` - Check if user has a specific permission
  - `assignRole()`, `removeRole()`, `getAllPermissions()`

- **Role Model**: Manages roles and their permissions
  - Many-to-many with users
  - Many-to-many with permissions
  - `hasPermission()`, `givePermissionTo()`, `revokePermissionTo()`

- **Permission Model**: Manages individual permissions
  - Many-to-many with roles

### 3. **Middleware for Authorization**
- **RoleMiddleware**: Checks if user has required role(s)
  - Usage: `->middleware('role:Admin,Manager')`
  - Returns 403 if unauthorized
  
- **PermissionMiddleware**: Checks if user has specific permission
  - Usage: `->middleware('permission:edit-users')`
  - Returns 403 if unauthorized

### 4. **Protected Routes**
Routes are now organized by access level:

**Public (authenticated users only):**
- Dashboard
- Profile
- Customers (view)
- Bookings (view/create/edit/delete)

**Admin + Manager only:**
- User Management
- Hotels, Trips, Boats
- Drivers, Vehicles, Transfer Contracts
- Diving Courses, Guides, Agencies
- Trip Programs
- Reports

**Admin only:**
- Roles Management
- Permissions Management

### 5. **Gates & Policies**
AppServiceProvider now includes:
- Automatic gate registration for all permissions
- Admin bypass (Admin role has all permissions)
- Custom Blade directives: `@role`, `@hasanyrole`, `@haspermission`

### 6. **Updated Views with Permission Checks**

**Users Index:**
- "Add User" button only visible with `create-users` permission
- Edit button only visible with `edit-users` permission
- Delete button only visible with `delete-users` permission
- Actions column hidden if user has no edit/delete permissions

**Roles Index:**
- "Add Role" button only visible with `create-roles` permission
- Edit/Delete buttons only visible with appropriate permissions
- Actions column hidden if user has no edit/delete permissions

**Permissions Index:**
- "Add Permission" button only visible with `create-permissions` permission
- Edit/Delete buttons only visible with appropriate permissions
- Actions column hidden if user has no edit/delete permissions

**Customers Index:**
- "Add Customer" button only visible with `create-customers` permission
- View button only visible with `view-customers` permission
- Edit button only visible with `edit-customers` permission
- Delete button only visible with `delete-customers` permission

**Bookings Index:**
- "Add Booking" button only visible with `create-bookings` permission
- Edit button only visible with `edit-bookings` permission
- Delete button only visible with `delete-bookings` permission

**Hotels Index:**
- "Add Hotel" button only visible to Admin and Manager roles
- Edit/Delete buttons only visible to Admin and Manager roles

### 7. **Navigation Menu (Sidebar)**
Updated to respect role restrictions:
- Menu items with `'roles' => ['Admin', 'Manager']` only visible to those roles
- User Management submenu filters based on permissions
- Automatically hides menu items user doesn't have access to

### 8. **Seeded Data**
- **3 Roles created:**
  - Admin: Has all 21 permissions
  - Manager: Has 8 permissions (view/create/edit customers & bookings)
  - User: Has 2 permissions (view customers & bookings)

- **21 Permissions created:**
  - User Management: view, create, edit, delete users
  - Role Management: view, create, edit, delete roles
  - Permission Management: view, create, edit, delete permissions
  - Customer Management: view, create, edit, delete customers
  - Booking Management: view, create, edit, delete bookings

- **Admin user** (admin@admin.com / 123123123) assigned Admin role

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Admins:
- Full access to everything
- Can manage users, roles, and permissions
- Can view all menu items
- All buttons visible

### For Managers:
- Can manage users
- Can manage master data (hotels, trips, boats, etc.)
- Can view reports
- **Cannot** manage roles or permissions
- Limited menu visibility

### For Regular Users:
- Can view customers and bookings
- **Cannot** create, edit, or delete anything
- Very limited menu visibility
- No action buttons visible in lists

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **Route-level protection**: Middleware prevents unauthorized access
2. **View-level protection**: Buttons hidden based on permissions
3. **Controller-level protection**: Can be added using `$this->authorize()`
4. **Admin bypass**: Admin always has all permissions
5. **403 errors**: Unauthorized access attempts return proper error

## 📝 How to Use

### Check permissions in views:
```blade
@can('edit-users')
    <!-- Show edit button -->
@endcan

@role('Admin')
    <!-- Show admin-only content -->
@endrole

@hasanyrole('Admin', 'Manager')
    <!-- Show manager or admin content -->
@endhasanyrole
```

### Apply middleware to routes:
```php
Route::middleware(['role:Admin'])->group(function() {
    // Admin-only routes
});

Route::middleware(['permission:edit-users'])->group(function() {
    // Routes requiring specific permission
});
```

### Check in controllers:
```php
if (auth()->user()->hasRole('Admin')) {
    // Admin logic
}

if (auth()->user()->hasPermission('edit-users')) {
    // Permission-specific logic
}
```

## ✨ Result

Users with "view-only" permissions will:
- ✅ See the list pages
- ❌ NOT see "Add" buttons
- ❌ NOT see "Edit" buttons  
- ❌ NOT see "Delete" buttons
- ❌ NOT see Actions column if they have no edit/delete permissions

The system is now fully functional with role-based access control!
