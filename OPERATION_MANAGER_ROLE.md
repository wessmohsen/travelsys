# Operation Manager Role - Implementation

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The "Operation Manager" role was not working because it wasn't properly registered in the system. Here's what was added:

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. **RoleSeeder Updated**
Added "Operation Manager" role with appropriate permissions:

**Slug**: `operation-manager`
**Name**: Operation Manager
**Description**: Operations manager with access to trip programs and master data

**Permissions Assigned (13 total)**:
- `view-customers`, `create-customers`, `edit-customers`
- `view-bookings`, `create-bookings`, `edit-bookings`

- `view-program-families`, `create-program-families`, `edit-program-families`, `delete-program-families`
- `view-reports`

### 2. **Routes Updated** (`routes/web.php`)
Added "Operation Manager" to middleware groups:

**Before**:
```php
Route::middleware(['role:Admin,Manager'])->group(function () {
    // Master data routes
});
```

**After**:
```php
Route::middleware(['role:Admin,Manager,Operation Manager'])->group(function () {
    // Master data routes
});
```

**Routes now accessible by Operation Manager**:
- Hotels, Trips, Boats
- Drivers, Vehicles, Transfer Contracts
- Diving Courses, Guides, Agencies
- Trip Programs and Program Families
- Reports

### 3. **Navigation Menu Updated** (`config/modules.php`)
Added "Operation Manager" to role checks in navigation:

**Updated Menu Items**:
- Hotels
- Trips
- Boats
- Transportation (Drivers, Vehicles, Transfer Contracts)
- Diving Courses
- Guides
- Agencies
- Operation Programs
- System Reports

## 🔄 How to Apply

   ```

   ```bash
   php artisan cache:clear
   php artisan config:clear
   php artisan route:clear
   php artisan view:clear
   ```

3. **Assign the role to a user**:

   - Edit the user
   - Select "Operation Manager" role
   - Save

## ✨ Operation Manager Access

Users with the "Operation Manager" role now have:

### ✅ **Full Access To**:
- Customers (create, edit, delete)
- Bookings (create, edit, delete)
- Trip Programs (create, edit, delete)
- Program Families (create, edit, delete)
- All master data (hotels, trips, boats, drivers, vehicles, guides, etc.)
- System reports

### ❌ **No Access To**:
- User Management (cannot create/edit users)
- Roles Management
- Permissions Management

### 📱 **Navigation Menu**:
- All operational menu items visible
- User Management menu only shows "My Profile"
- No Roles or Permissions menu items

## 🎯 Use Case

**Operation Manager** is perfect for users who need to:
- Manage daily operations
- Handle trip programs and families
- Update master data
- View reports
- **BUT** should not manage system users or permissions

This is the middle tier between Admin and regular User - focused on operations rather than system administration.
